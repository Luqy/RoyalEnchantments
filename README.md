# RoyalEnchantments
Quite a lot of static abuse, need to fix that up. 
Don't know why I named my main class Main.


This is an open source custom enchantments plugin. Compile it and type /shard. Change it up and do whatever you want with it. Adding pictures soon. I do see many classes that could have a lot of improvments, will be working on that soon.
